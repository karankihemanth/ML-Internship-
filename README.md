🍔 Fast Food Market Segmentation Analysis

📋 Project Overview
This project implements a market segmentation analysis for the fast food industry using Python. The analysis follows the Ten Steps of Market Segmentation as outlined in the "Market Segmentation Analysis" book. It leverages data-driven methods like clustering and PCA to identify and profile customer segments effectively.

The code is designed to be Google Colab-compatible, enabling easy execution and visualization of results.
